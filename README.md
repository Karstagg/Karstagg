***Hi there***

#### A little bit about me:

I am a Software Engineer specializing in React and React Native. I've been lucky enough to live all over the world, (currently in Tokyo), but its time for me to get back to the USA. I'm currently looking for remote work building with React or React Native, or some awesome open source projects to contribute to!

In addition to programming i'm also an avid traveler, techie, audiophile, language nerd, and foodie / amateur chef.

Feel free to check out my [website / blog](https://www.mfisher.dev) for more!
