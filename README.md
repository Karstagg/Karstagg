***Hello Github***

#### A little bit about me:

I am a product manager and software engineer specializing in mobile apps. My personal engineering experience is largely in React and React-Native, but I've dabbled in Swift, Elixir, Kotlin, PHP, and a whole menagerie of JavaScript libraries and fameworks.

I began my software journey developing web content, but quickly became interested in developing fully feldged applications. Now, ss someone who passionately believes that every successful application begins with an engaged and unified cross-disiplinary team, moving into product management seems like the logical next step in my carreer journey. I am currently splitting my time about 50/50 between development and product management and loving every second of it.

In addition to being a product persopn and an engineerm, i'm also an avid traveler, techie, audiophile, language nerd, and foodie / amateur chef.
